Problema
Given n, i.e. total number of nodes in an undirected graph numbered from 1 to n and an integer e, i.e. total number of edges in the graph. Calculate the total number of connected components in the graph. A connected component is a set of vertices in a graph that are linked to each other by paths.
Input Format:
First line of input line contains two integers n and e. Next e line will contain two integers u and v meaning that node u and node v are connected to each other in undirected fashion. 
Output Format:
For each input graph print an integer x denoting total number of connected components.
Constraints:
All the input values are well with in the integer range.
